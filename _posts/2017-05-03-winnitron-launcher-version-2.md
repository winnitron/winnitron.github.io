GET HYPE!!  [VERSION 2.0 IS OUT](https://github.com/winnitron/WinnitronLauncher/releases/tag/v2.0.0)!!

After a lot of hard work from [Aaron](https://twitter.com/aaronklaassen) and [Marlon](https://twitter.com/mr_m_wiebe) to get the Autohotkey stuff working right, and a lot of bugtesting and help from [Ludonaut](https://twitter.com/Ludonaut), [Daniel](https://twitter.com/hyperscope), [Dylan](https://twitter.com/vagabond_king), and the rest of the [Winnipeg Game Jam](https://twitter.com/WinnipegGameJam) crew, we think we got all the core features in to the Winnitron Launcher that we can safely say this thing is ready!

It's not perfect, we'll need a ton more testing yet, and we still got a [few things we want to implement](https://github.com/orgs/winnitron/projects/1), so go make a Winnitron if you don't have one and download the launcher!  Please report any bugs to [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/winnitron/WinnitronLauncher/issues)!

Don't forget that the [Winnitron Network](http://network.winnitron.com) is constantly being improved as well.  You can manage your winnitron from there, put games on your machine and upload games.

Thanks!!
