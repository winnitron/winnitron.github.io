Hey!  Welcome to the new Winnitron website.  We're excited to show you some of the stuff we've been working on in the last couple months.

The Winnitron project is now [entirely on GitHub](http://github.com/winnitron), if you're web inclined you could help us with the [design of this site](https://github.com/winnitron/winnitron.github.io) or the [Winnitron Network](http://network.winnitron.com) where you can manage the games on your Winnitron easily.  If you have some Unity background, feel free to [fork the launcher](https://github.com/winnitron/WinnitronLauncher) and tackle some the [issues](https://github.com/winnitron/WinnitronLauncher/issues).

We also just made a [Winnitron subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/winnitron) for more conversation, so if you have any questions comments or concerns, post 'em on this post or over on the reddit.  We're still trying to figure out the best way to stay in touch with Winnitron users, so let us know!

Thanks!
