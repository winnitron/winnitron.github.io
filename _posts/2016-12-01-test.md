Heck yeah! Winnitron Network beta is open. If any of you would like to take the new launcher and website out for a spin (and hopefully give us some feedback), that would be awesome.

Go download the launcher from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/winnitron/WinnitronLauncher/releases), there will be installation instructions on the wiki there.

Go to the [Winnitron Network site](http://network.winnitron.com) and sign up, etc.  Don’t judge the design (i.e. lack thereof) too harshly quite yet; we’re mainly looking for bugs and what you think about general workflows etc right now.  Post any issues you have with the site on the relevant [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/winnitron/winnitron_reborn/issues).

Post feedback or questions on this post or on the [Winnitron Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/winnitron/comments/5frgkl/release_winnitron_v2beta1/) and submit any glaring issues on our [GitHub issues page for the launcher](https://github.com/winnitron/WinnitronLauncher/issues).

Note that everything is still very much a work in progress and we need your help to get it all working smoothly!

Thanks!
