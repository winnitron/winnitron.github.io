![A GAME BY IT'S COVER]({{site.url}}/images/posts/2017/agbic.png)

Hey guys, we're officially a part of the annual [A Game By it's Cover Jam](https://itch.io/jam/a-game-by-its-cover-2017)!

Make your game so that it works with the Winnitron as a optional added challenge.  We often find that the simple control schemes, and fast pace help with lowering scope.

If you're bummed out that all these other people get to play it on their Winnitrons, don't fret!  You too can [make your own Winnitron](https://github.com/winnitron/WinnitronLauncher/wiki/Building-a-Winnitron-Cabinet) for your indie game community.  Get building! :)
