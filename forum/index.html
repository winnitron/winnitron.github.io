            <h2>The Winnitron Forums are No Longer</h2>
            <p>Due to several reasons, not least of which is the fact that our attention being split elsewhere with things like jobs, we've had to take the forums down.  They were just too costly to run for what they were.</p>
            <p>The Winnitron held a special place for me since it was the thing that got me into making games and then game trailers which is now my full time job.  So, I thought I was doing it justice by trying to keep it alive, but I don't think I'm cut out for managing a community and project like this so I feel like it's best to just let it go.</p>
            <p>We've moved the launcher over to <a href="https://github.com/winnitron">Github</a> and you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/winnitron/WinnitronLauncher/wiki">launcher wiki</a> and <a href="https://github.com/winnitron/WinnitronLauncher/releases">download the latest launcher there</a>.  If you want to fork it and make your own, by all means!</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about the Winnitron, you can get in touch with me on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/mr_m_wiebe">@mr_m_wiebe</a>.</p>
            <p>Thanks!</p>
